<h1>Bug Report</h1>
<p>
 The grand majority of coding-related bug reports that we receive are errors on the user's part.

 If you think that there's an issue with a question, yet the question has been successfully submitted thousands or even tens of thousands of times, odds are that there isn't an actual issue.
 
 We urge you to take some time to reread the prompt, hints, and tests and to debug your code before proceeding with submitting a bug report.
